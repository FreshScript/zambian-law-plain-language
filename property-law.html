  <h1>Property Law in Zambia</h1>

  <p>
    Property law in Zambia protects your right to own, use, and transfer property. It covers land, homes, livestock, personal items, and even things like phones or furniture.
  </p>

  <h2>Types of Property</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Movable property:</strong> These are items you can carry or move — phones, clothes, furniture, money, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Immovable property:</strong> Land and anything permanently attached to land, like houses or trees.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Ways You Can Own Property</h2>
  <p>You can legally own property in the following ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Individual ownership:</strong> Owned by one person.</li>
    <li><strong>Joint ownership:</strong> Owned by more than one person — common in marriages or family land.</li>
    <li><strong>Leasehold ownership:</strong> You get land or property for a period (usually up to 99 years), especially on state land.</li>
    <li><strong>Customary use:</strong> Land allocated by traditional leaders under customary law.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Your Rights as a Property Owner</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use and enjoy the property without interference.</li>
    <li>Sell, give away, rent, or leave your property in a will.</li>
    <li>Protect it from theft or damage by going to court or police.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When Property Is Shared</h2>
  <p>In marriages and families, property may be jointly owned — both partners may have a claim. If a couple divorces or one dies, courts may divide property based on who contributed or what’s fair.</p>

  <h2>Common Property Disputes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> Who gets what after someone dies?</li>
    <li><strong>Eviction:</strong> Can a landlord remove a tenant without proper notice? (Answer: No)</li>
    <li><strong>Family land conflicts:</strong> Often arise in rural areas over customary land use or boundaries.</li>
    <li><strong>Property taken as collateral:</strong> Lenders must follow the law before repossessing.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>If Someone Steals or Destroys Your Property</h2>
  
  <p>You can report the matter to the police or open a civil case in local or magistrate courts. Make sure to keep records of ownership like receipts, agreements, or witnesses.</p>
