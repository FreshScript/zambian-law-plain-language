  <h1>Gender-Based Violence in Zambia</h1>
  <main>
  <p>
    Gender-Based Violence (GBV) is any act that causes physical, emotional, or sexual harm to someone because of their gender. In Zambia, GBV mostly affects women and girls, but men and boys can be victims too. GBV is a serious crime under Zambian law.
  </p>

  <h2>Forms of Gender-Based Violence</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Physical Abuse:</strong> Hitting, slapping, kicking, or burning someone.</li>
    <li><strong>Emotional or Psychological Abuse:</strong> Insults, threats, humiliation, controlling behavior, or isolation.</li>
    <li><strong>Sexual Abuse:</strong> Rape, forced sex in marriage, or touching someone without their consent.</li>
    <li><strong>Economic Abuse:</strong> Controlling someone’s money, refusing to provide for family, or stopping someone from working.</li>
    <li><strong>Child Marriage:</strong> Forcing a girl (or boy) under 18 into marriage is illegal and a form of GBV.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>GBV in the Home</h2>
  <p>
    Most GBV happens in homes — by husbands, partners, parents, or relatives. This is called <strong>domestic violence</strong>. It can be ongoing, even if there are no visible injuries.
  </p>

  <h2>Is Marital Rape a Crime?</h2>
  <p>
    Yes. The law now recognizes that <strong>forced sex in marriage is rape</strong>. Being married does not give someone the right to sex without consent.
  </p>

  <h2>Where to Report GBV</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Police Victim Support Unit (VSU):</strong> Found in most police stations. Officers are trained to handle GBV cases sensitively.</li>
    <li><strong>One-Stop Centres:</strong> Found in some hospitals. They offer medical care, counseling, and legal help.</li>
    <li><strong>Social Welfare and NGOs:</strong> Like YWCA, Lifeline/Childline Zambia, and Women’s Rights groups.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Legal Protection for Victims</h2>
  <p>
    Victims of GBV can apply for:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Protection Orders:</strong> A court order to stop an abuser from contacting or harming you.</li>
    <li><strong>Emergency Shelter:</strong> Safe places where victims (especially women and children) can stay temporarily.</li>
    <li><strong>Medical Reports:</strong> Hospitals provide reports for police cases and court.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What the Law Says</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The <strong>Anti-Gender Based Violence Act of 2011</strong> makes it a crime to abuse or harm someone because of their gender.</li>
    <li>GBV crimes can result in fines, imprisonment, or both — depending on the severity.</li>
    <li>Children are protected under the <strong>Children’s Code Act</strong> and should not be forced into marriage or labor.</li>
  </ul>

  </main>

  <p>
    Victims of GBV should not stay silent. Support is available — and the law is on your side.
