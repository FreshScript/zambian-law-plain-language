  <h1>Employment and Workers’ Rights in Zambia</h1>

  <main>
  <p>
    Everyone who works in Zambia has rights protected by law. Whether you work in an office, factory, farm, or as a casual worker, knowing your rights helps you stay safe and be treated fairly.
  </p>

  <h2>Employment Contracts</h2>
  <p>
    Most jobs require a contract — this is a written or spoken agreement between you and your employer. It should explain:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your job duties</li>
    <li>Working hours and days</li>
    <li>How much you will be paid and when</li>
    <li>Leave (holidays, sick leave, maternity/paternity leave)</li>
    <li>How to end the job (notice period)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Working Hours and Overtime</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The normal working week is <strong>8 hours a day, 48 hours per week</strong>.</li>
    <li>Overtime must be paid extra, usually at 1.5 times the normal wage.</li>
    <li>Workers have the right to rest breaks and at least one day off each week.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Wages and Payment</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You must be paid at least the <strong>minimum wage</strong>, set by the government.</li>
    <li>Your employer must pay you on time and not hold your salary without good reason.</li>
    <li>Deductions from salary are only allowed if you agree or it is required by law (e.g., taxes, social security).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Leave Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Annual leave:</strong> At least 21 days paid holiday per year.</li>
    <li><strong>Sick leave:</strong> Paid leave if you are ill, supported by a medical certificate.</li>
    <li><strong>Maternity leave:</strong> 84 days paid leave for women, with protection against dismissal.</li>
    <li><strong>Paternity leave:</strong> Some employers offer it, though not always required by law.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Unfair Dismissal and Termination</h2>
  <p>
    Your employer cannot fire you without a valid reason. Reasons must be fair and follow legal procedure:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Warning and chance to improve if you perform poorly.</li>
    <li>Following company rules and contracts.</li>
    <li>Proper notice period before ending the contract.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Workplace Safety and Health</h2>
  <p>
    Employers must provide a safe working environment and protect workers from accidents or illnesses.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use protective equipment if needed.</li>
    <li>Report hazards or unsafe conditions.</li>
    <li>Access to first aid and emergency help.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Workers’ Rights to Organize</h2>
  <p>
    You have the right to join or form a trade union to protect your interests and negotiate better conditions.
  </p>

  <h2>Where to Get Help</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Labour Office:</strong> Offers mediation and advice on disputes.</li>
    <li><strong>Trade Unions:</strong> Can support members with legal advice and representation.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal Aid Clinics:</strong> Help workers who cannot afford lawyers.</li>
  </ul>
  </main>

  <p>
    Knowing your rights helps you work with dignity and fairness. Don’t be afraid to ask questions or seek help.
