  <h1>Police and Your Rights in Zambia</h1>
  <main>
  <p>
    In Zambia, the police are meant to protect life, property, and the law. But every citizen has rights that must be respected, even when the police are doing their job.
  </p>

  <h2>When You’re Stopped by Police</h2>
  <p>You may be stopped while walking, driving, or at a roadblock. In these situations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Stay calm and respectful.</li>
    <li>You can ask: “Why am I being stopped?”</li>
    <li>You’re only required to provide your name, national registration card (NRC), or driving license if asked.</li>
    <li>You have the right to be spoken to politely and not be harassed or insulted.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Search and Seizure</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Police need a **search warrant** to enter your home, unless there’s an emergency (e.g., someone’s in danger).</li>
    <li>They can only search your body, car, or bag if they have reasonable cause — and they should explain why.</li>
    <li>Women should be searched by female officers whenever possible.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When You Are Arrested</h2>
  <p>If you're arrested, here’s what must happen:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The officer must tell you why you’re being arrested.</li>
    <li>You have the <strong>right to remain silent</strong> — you don’t have to answer questions without a lawyer.</li>
    <li>You must be taken to court within <strong>48 hours.</strong> Longer than that is unlawful unless a judge approves it.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Your Rights in Police Custody</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You have a right to call a relative or lawyer.</li>
    <li>You must be treated with dignity — no beatings, torture, or inhumane conditions.</li>
    <li>Children or minors must be separated from adult suspects.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Right to Bail</h2>
  <p>
    For most charges, you can apply for bail while your case is ongoing. Serious offences like murder may not qualify for bail. Bail may be granted by a police officer, magistrate, or judge.
  </p>

  <h2>If Your Rights Are Violated</h2>
  <p>If you’re abused by a police officer:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Report to the <strong>Police Public Complaints Commission</strong> (PPCC).</li>
    <li>You can also take civil legal action for compensation through the courts.</li>
    <li>Human rights groups and legal aid offices can support your case if you cannot afford a lawyer.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Your Role as a Citizen</h2>
  <p>While the police must act lawfully, citizens also have responsibilities:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Follow lawful instructions during a search or arrest.</li>
    <li>Do not obstruct officers in the line of duty.</li>
    <li>Report crime or misconduct responsibly and truthfully.</li>
  </ul>
