  <h1>Land Ownership in Zambia</h1>
  <main>
  <p>
    Land is one of the most valuable resources in Zambia. The law gives citizens the right to own, use, and transfer land, but land ownership comes in different forms depending on how and where it is acquired.
  </p>

  <h2>Types of Land in Zambia</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Customary Land:</strong> Managed by traditional chiefs. About 70% of Zambia’s land falls under this type. It’s often inherited or given by village authorities and is not titled unless converted.</li>
    <li><strong>State Land:</strong> Managed by the Ministry of Lands and local councils. This is where you apply formally, pay fees, and get official title deeds.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to Acquire Land</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Customary Land:</strong> Approach the chief or headperson. You may receive a recommendation letter or traditional allocation note. This can later be converted to state land.</li>
    <li><strong>State Land:</strong> Apply through the local council or Ministry of Lands. You may be asked to submit an application letter, national registration card, and drawings or maps of the land.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Title Deeds and Leasehold</h2>
  <p>
    On state land, land is usually given under a <strong>99-year leasehold</strong>. A title deed is proof that you are the legal owner. It can be used to get loans, sell the land, or protect your rights in court.
  </p>

  <h2>Land Use and Responsibilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You must use the land for the purpose stated (farming, residence, business, etc.)</li>
    <li>You may be required to develop the land within a set period (e.g., 18 months).</li>
    <li>Land not used properly can be repossessed by the council or ministry.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common Land Disputes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Double allocation:</strong> Two people sold the same land. This often happens without title deeds.</li>
    <li><strong>Unclear boundaries:</strong> Especially in rural areas with no surveyors.</li>
    <li><strong>Chief vs. Government authority:</strong> Overlapping power in land decisions.</li>
    <li><strong>Inheritance disputes:</strong> After a landowner dies without a will.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These disputes are handled by the <strong>Lands Tribunal</strong>, local courts, or in some cases the High Court. Before buying any land, always check for a title deed or visit the council for clearance.</p>

  <h2>Tips to Protect Your Land Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep a written agreement or receipt when buying land — signed and witnessed.</li>
    <li>Make sure land is surveyed and registered with the council or Ministry.</li>
    <li>Ask neighbours and local leaders about ownership history before paying.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Many Zambians have lost land due to poor documentation or fake sellers. When in doubt, consult a legal officer, council official, or local land agent.
